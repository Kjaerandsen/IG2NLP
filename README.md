# IG2-NLP

IG2-NLP is a set of tools to facilitate automation of the annotation process for annotating 
institutional statements to the IG Script notation of the Institutional Grammar 2.0.
This includes an automatic annotator, and several utilities to facilitate the testing and development
of this annotator.

The folder "ig2nlp" includes the programs for automatically parsing institutional statements and other testing functions. 

The "data" folder includes all relevant data including program input and output files and configuration.

The automated annotations are based on the Stanza NLP toolkit and a manual matching function based on matching dependencies from dependency parsing, NER, POS-tags and more to components of the IG 2.0.
